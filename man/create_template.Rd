\arguments{
\item{new_template}{TRUE/FALSE; default is false otherwise if true, will pull the last saved stock assessment report skeleton}

\item{format}{file type for the render (i.e. pdf, docx, html)}

\item{office}{regional fisheries science center producing the report (AFSC, NEFSC, NWFSC, PIFSC, SEFSC, SWFSC)}

\item{region}{Abbreviated region in which the species is evaluated if applicable; i.e. GOM, SA, BSAI, GOA. Note: if this is not specificed for your science center then do not use this variable. The specific location for the species should be added as a parameter in param_names and param_values}

\item{complex}{Is this a species complex? "YES" or "NO"}

\item{species}{full common name for target species, split naming by a space and capitalize first letter(s)}

\item{year}{year the assessment is being conducted, default is current year report is being rendered}

\item{new_author}{TRUE/FALSE; default is FALSE - pulls from list of authors in repo}

\item{author_name}{"First Last" name of author being added to the report}

\item{author_office}{Abbreviation of the science center of the author being added}

\item{include_affiliation}{TRUE/FALSE; does the analyst want to include affiliations of the authors in the document?}

\item{parameters}{TRUE/FALSE; default TRUE - for parameterization of the script}

\item{param_names}{List of parameter names that will be called in the document; example: c("office", "region", "spp")}

\item{param_values}{List of values associated with the order of parameter names; example: c("SEFSC", "Gulf of Mexico", "Red Snapper")}

\item{resdir}{Directory where the model results file(s) are located}

\item{model_results}{Name of the model results file}

\item{model}{Type of assessment model that was used to assess the stock (i.e. "BAM", "SS", "AMAK", "ASAP", ect)}

\item{add_section}{TRUE/FALSE; is there an additional section that the analyst wants to add to the skeleton? Default is false}

\item{secdir}{Directory where the .qmd file is located (new file made by the analyst)}

\item{new_section}{File name of the new section}

\item{section_location}{Location where the section should be added relative to the base skeleton document}

\item{type}{Type of stock assessment report - terminology will vary by region (content already configured by region)}
}
\value{
Create template and pull skeleton for a stock assessment report.
Function builds a YAML specific to the region and utilizes current
resources and workflows from different U.S. Fishery Science Centers.
General sections are called as child documents in this skeleton and
each of the child documents should be edited separately.
